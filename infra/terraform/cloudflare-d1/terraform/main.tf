# --- The platform database ---
#
# One D1 database per environment holds every bounded context's tables. They
# are separated by name prefix (`identity_users`, `membership_organizations`,
# …) rather than by Postgres schema, because SQLite has no schemas — the
# bounded-context boundary is enforced in the repositories, as it always was.
#
# Why one database and not one per context: D1 offers no cross-database query
# or foreign key, and the console's read paths join across contexts (an org's
# members and their user records, an invoice and its subscription). Splitting
# would move those joins into the workers, which is a much larger change than
# the isolation is worth at this size.

  # the baseline. Workers resolve the database by ID through the wiring secret,
  # so the name is free to change.
