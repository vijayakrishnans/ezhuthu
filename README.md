# ezhuthu

Reusable **Cloudflare-only** multi-tenant SaaS starter, built as an
[Orun](https://opencode.ai/docs) component-native desired-state repo. Identity,
organizations, projects, RBAC, audit, metering, billing, webhooks, and
notifications ship as separate bounded-context Cloudflare Workers behind a single
public edge API, with a Next.js console on Workers + Static Assets — and
Cloudflare D1 as the database, so Cloudflare is the only provider in the loop.

## Live deployment

<!-- 08-docs:begin -->
_Not yet recorded — run [`08-docs`](docs/phases/08-docs.md) after
`06-console` to fill this section from verified live state
([manifest](ai/context/deployment.md) · [operating contract](ai/context/operations.md))._
<!-- 08-docs:end -->

## Status

- **Runtime is live, per environment, through Orun.** The edge API, the
  bounded-context Workers, and the console deploy to `stage` and `prod` via
  `orun run` (no direct Wrangler/Terraform/pnpm in CI).
- **Data plane is provisioned by Terraform:** a Cloudflare D1 database per
  environment and the `api-edge` idempotency KV namespace. Terraform state
  lives in the Orun Cloud HTTP state backend; provider credentials are
  BROKERED per-run from the workspace's Cloudflare connection (no AWS, no
  long-lived secrets at rest).
- **Database migrations** run through the `db-migrate` component against D1's
  REST API (plan on PRs, apply on merge to `main`).
- **Billing** is live end-to-end via the Polar adapter (embedded checkout,
  plan changes, multi-org fan-out).
- **Known credential-blocked tails**: full production OAuth/magic-link auth
  and Stripe require human-supplied credentials. The notifications email
  provider is Cloudflare Email Service (`cloudflare-email`, no API key — the
  `send_email` binding is the credential); it needs one-time account setup:
  Workers Paid plan and the sending domain verified in Email Service
  (DKIM/SPF).
- The `dev` environment is verify-only (no provisioned database by design).

## Why Cloudflare-only

One provider means one consent, one token, and one place to look when
something breaks. The cost is D1's shape, and this baseline is explicit about
it rather than quiet:

- **No interactive transactions.** D1 offers atomic `batch()` for a statement
  list decided up front, not a transaction held open across reads and writes.
  `executor.transaction(...)` therefore runs its statements in order with no
  rollback; every call site is a place a reviewer should look first. Prefer a
  single statement with `RETURNING`, or an upsert with `ON CONFLICT`, where
  all-or-nothing actually matters.
- **SQLite types.** Timestamps are ISO-8601 text, JSON documents are text,
  booleans are 0/1. `@saas/db/json` owns the decoding so row mappers never
  guess.
- **No schemas.** The bounded-context boundary is a table-name prefix
  (`identity_users`, `membership_organizations`) enforced by the
  repositories — which is where it was actually enforced under Postgres too.

## Instantiating products

This baseline births new products from one artifact — `repo-blueprint.yaml`,
run by `orun new` (**[BOOTSTRAP.md](BOOTSTRAP.md)** →
[docs/phases/](docs/phases/README.md)). It declares nine idempotent phases —
scaffold, foundation, infrastructure, workers, workers-restore, edge,
console, optional domain, docs — each landing a verified slice, each
selectable with `--phase <name>`. Products receive **product-only content**
(source, infra, CI, their own docs); none of this baseline's machinery
ships, and a product's docs speak only about the product.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20 (CI and components run on Node 22)
- pnpm >= 10 (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- (Optional, for local Orun validation) the `kiox` CLI on your `PATH`. `kiox`
  pins the Orun provider declared in `kiox.yaml`; invoke Orun as
  `kiox -- orun ...`.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install all workspace dependencies
pnpm install

# Type-check / lint / test / build across the workspace (Turborepo)
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Execution contracts (the composition stack) are not vendored here. They are
consumed from the published catalog at
`oci://ghcr.io/sourceplane/stack-tectonic`, pinned to an explicit version in
`intent.yaml`. Composition changes are made in
[sourceplane/stack-tectonic](https://github.com/sourceplane/stack-tectonic),
released there, and adopted here by bumping the pinned tag.

## CI

CI is powered by [Orun](https://opencode.ai/docs) with the local Stack Tectonic
composition stack. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` calls only `orun plan` and
`orun run` — no direct `pnpm`, `turbo`, Wrangler, or Terraform commands run in
GitHub Actions. The Orun runtime is pinned in `kiox.yaml` (resolved digest in
`kiox.lock`); the workflow's `orun-action` `version:` matches that pin.

### Local Orun Verification

```bash
kiox -- orun compositions lock --intent intent.yaml
kiox -- orun validate --intent intent.yaml
kiox -- orun plan --changed --intent intent.yaml --output plan.json
kiox -- orun run --plan plan.json --dry-run --runner github-actions
```

Use `--changed` for PR-scoped checks; use a full plan when validating
environment promotion or cross-component dependencies (`--view dag`).

## Infrastructure

Terraform provisions the D1 database and the `api-edge` KV namespace for
`stage` and `prod`. Both roots carry `adopt.tf`, which imports an existing
resource at plan time instead of colliding with it — so a re-bootstrap over a
half-torn-down attempt heals rather than fails. Credentials are brokered per
run from the workspace's Cloudflare connection and Terraform state lives on
the platform; nothing provider-shaped is stored in this repo or in GitHub.
See `specs/core/access-and-infra.md` for the access model.

## Adding a New Component

1. Create the directory under `apps/`, `packages/`, `tests/`, or `infra/`.
2. Add a `component.yaml` with the appropriate `spec.type` — one of
   `cloudflare-worker-turbo`, `cloudflare-workers-assets-turbo`, `terraform`,
   `db-migrate`, or `turbo-package` — plus `subscribe.environments` and the
   typed `parameters` the composition schema requires.
3. Orun discovers it automatically on the next plan (`discovery.roots` covers
   `apps/`, `infra/`, `packages/`, `tests/`). Validate with
   `kiox -- orun validate --intent intent.yaml`.

See `specs/core/orun-golden-path.md` for the intent/component/composition layer
rules before changing CI, infra, or `intent.yaml`.
